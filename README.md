# nba-player-guessing-game-hci584
A guessing game that randomly selects an NBA player from the 2022-23 season, then provides five hints to the user in order for them to correctly guess the player.

## **Description**
To begin, we import the CSV with data from NBA.com. The table is a list of NBA players and their statistics from the previous season. Once the data has been imported, I select a random from the CSV file. After a row has been identified, I define the hints: points per game, rebounds per game, assist per game, age, and team. The user is given five opportunities to make their guess to name the NBA player. Beginning with points per game, I provide users with an additional clue after each incorrect guess. If the user is unable to name the NBA player and all hints have been provided, the game is over.
